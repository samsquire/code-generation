Can we generate sourcecode for algorithms automatically?

# a star algorithm

A star algorithm is kind of intelligent, it uses a cost function and a heuristic.

What is the cost function for lines of code? That get nearer to the output values?

Project the output data or desired result onto a multidimensional surface.

We move the inputs the lines of code to change the output movement.

But what of ordering of code?

One line of code changes the possibilities for the next line of code.

The neighbours of the current code are the possibilities of the current line of code.

What if the reverse mapping? From desired output to source data.

How do you move toward an answer with the intermediately generated code?

Transform the shape of the input data to the destination data

Join on all the fields of objects

Rule recognition if the pattern is the same for all joins.

If not there is some other property.

Could have a set of primitives: create new object, create recursive call, loop

Then when the structure of the input data matches output data you need to find the conditions to get to the output structure.

The distance function needs to compare the input data structure to the candidate data structure.

But without brute forcing how do you search an opportunity in depth. You need intelligence to go in a direction
